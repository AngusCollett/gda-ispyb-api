# Contributing

For any major changes, please first make a ticket either on Github or in Diamond's JIRA if you have access to that, in order to discuss the changes you wish to make.

## Pull Request Process For Table Changes

1. Please test your changes locally before you make a pull request. This requires a local MariaDB database.
2. Please write tests for your changes, and make sure the tests run successfully.
3. Please make sure your changes don't break any existing tests.
4. Once you make the pull request, Travis will automatically run to test the changes. You can find the results [here](https://travis-ci.org/DiamondLightSource/gda-ispyb-api).
