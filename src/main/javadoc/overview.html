        <p>This is a Java library for accessing a Diamond-flavour ISPyB database. It's designed for server-side-only 
            usage, utilising stored procedures to access the database tables. A key benefit of this apporach is the 
            ability to modify the behaviour of the library methods without downtime and without building and 
            deploying a new version of the library itself. A simple change to a stored procedure is very quick and 
            runs in a transaction without disrupting access to the database.</p>

        <p>The stored procedures are maintained in a separate repository: <a href='https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/ispyb-database'>ispyb-database</a></p>
